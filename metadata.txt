name=Flow Map Curved Arrow Calculator
qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
description=Converts straight lines representing non-branching origin-destination flows to curves
version=1.0
author=Patrick Malcolm
email=patmalcolm91@gmail.com

about=Converts straight flow map lines to bezier curves using the algorithm described in http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2017.1307378 which avoids lines overlapping nodes, minimizes line intersections, and increases angular resolution at nodes, among other criteria.
